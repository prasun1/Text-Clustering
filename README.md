# Text-Clustering
The objectives of this project are the following:   Implement the DBSCAN clustering algorithm.   Deal with text data (news records) in document-term sparse matrix format.   Design a proximity function for text data.   Think about the Curse of Dimensionality.   Use dimensionality reduction if needed.   Think about best metrics for evaluating clustering solutions.
